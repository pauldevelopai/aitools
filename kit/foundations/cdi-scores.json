  "content": "Each tool in this toolkit is rated on the following three dimensions:\nCost (0–10). 0 means free. 10 means expensive. This measures affordability. Is this\nrealistic for a freelance journalist or small newsroom or is it priced for a well-funded\norganisation?\nDifficulty (0–10)\n0 means “click and go.” 10 means advanced technical or coding skills are required.\nThis indicates how much technical knowledge is needed to use the tool effectively.\nInvasiveness (0–10)\n0 means the tool runs locally or offline and keeps data on your own device.\n10 means your data is uploaded, stored, or used to train external models.\nThis reflects the privacy and security trade-offs involved in using the tool.\nAn example of how to read the CDI score:\nA cloud-based transcription service might have a CDI score of 3–1–6:\nCost: 3 — affordable for most journalists.\nDifficulty: 1 — simple, drag-and-drop interface.\nInvasiveness: 6 — audio files are uploaded to external servers.\nThis tells students and lecturers that the tool is easy to use and affordable, but may be\nunsuitable for sensitive interviews.\nBy contrast, an open-source transcription tool that runs locally might score 0–8–0:\nCost: 0 — free.\nDifficulty: 8 — requires considerable technical setup.\nInvasiveness: 0 — data never leaves the device.\nThis makes it a better option for high-risk reporting, even though it is harder to use.\nThe CDI score is not a verdict. It is a conversation starter. When teaching classes, it helps\nstudents understand trade-offs, compare tools responsibly and make informed\ndecisions based on their resources, skills and security needs."
