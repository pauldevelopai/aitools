  "content": "Top 10 AI Use Cases of AI in Journalism\nHere are the primary ways the AI is transforming journalism and real-world examples to\nillustrate.\n1. Audience Engagement via Chatbots and Interactive Tools\nNews organizations are using AI-driven chatbots and interactive assistants to engage readers\nin conversation, answer questions and provide personalized information. These tools can\nmake the news more accessible and interactive for audiences:\nExample: Four small newsrooms launched custom AI chatbots 14 in about a month. These are\nlocal outlets using lightweight chatbots specifically to keep readers on-site and answer practical\nquestions instead of bouncing to search and social media.\n2. Automated News Writing for Routine Coverage Many newsrooms are leveraging AI to automate the writing of routine news items – things like\nweather updates, sports recaps, stock reports, or local crime blotters.15\nExample: In Slovakia, some media outlets used AI to generate content based on real-time\nresults during recent elections, with *AI helping to produce hundreds, sometimes thousands, of\narticles covering the results in each municipality, freeing editorial staff from manually writing\nrepetitive, data-driven stories.\n3. AI-Assisted Writing and Editing\nRather than writing entire articles autonomously, AI is also used as a smart assistant for\njournalists and editors. These tools can proofread text, suggest better headlines, improve clarity\nor even propose interview questions and sources.\nExample: Gubbi Labs (India) This is a small science news organization in India, built an AI-\nassisted workflow tool (“Babbler”) to speed up writing and editing of science stories.16 The\nsystem can take dense academic research articles and automatically transform them into draft\nnews stories in a more engaging, layperson-friendly style. Journalists then polish these drafts,\nwhich has significantly increased the team’s content output while maintaining quality.\n4. Fact-Checking and Misinformation Detection\nVerifying information and debunking false claims is a critical part of journalism. AI systems can\nassist fact-checkers by scanning content for claims, comparing them against databases, and\nflagging potential falsehoods or inconsistencies.\nExample: Nest Center (Mongolia). Mongolia’s Nest Center for Journalism Innovation and\nDevelopment built the country’s first AI-driven fact-checking and sentiment analysis system.17\nIntegrated into their Pluma news platform, this tool automatically flags suspicious claims and\nhostile narratives in Mongolian social media content. It scans large volumes of posts for\ndisinformation patterns and even gauges sentiment, alerting the small fact-checking team to\npotential fake news so they can investigate and debunk them promptly.\n5. Investigative Research and Data Analysis\nAI is helping journalists find the needle in the haystack when digging through large datasets,\npublic records, or documents. Small investigative teams can use machine learning and NLP\n(natural language processing) to uncover patterns or leads that would be hard to spot manually.\nExample: Dataphyte (Nigeria). Investigative outlet Dataphyte created Nubia AI, which\ncombines data analytics with story writing to assist deep dives.18 Reporters can upload large\ndatasets (e.g. government budgets or health records) and ask Nubia questions; the AI then\nanalyzes every row for trends or anomalies and generates draft narratives. For example, in\n2025 a Dataphyte journalist used Nubia to crunch Nigeria’s electricity distribution data – the AI\nnigeria spotted patterns and produced analytical text, which the reporter refined in his own style. This\nsaved hours of manual number-crunching and helped uncover hidden insights for investigative\nstories.\n6. Personalized Content Recommendations\nTo keep readers engaged in the era of information overload, news companies are turning to AI\nrecommendation engines. These systems learn from user behavior and preferences to suggest\nnews stories or deliver tailored newsletters that match individual interests. Personalization can\nincrease reader loyalty and content consumption.\nExample: Makedonia (Greece) 19. Historic regional newspaper Makedonia reinvented itself\nwith an AI-powered personalized newsletter system. Their tool analyzes each reader’s behavior\nand preferences on the site and then automatically curates a customized email newsletter and\nmobile push alerts for that individual. For example, a local reader interested in sports and city\npolitics will get a different mix of stories than someone who clicks mainly on culture pieces. This\npersonalisation initiative has re-engaged lapsed readers and attracted younger audiences,\ncreating a more loyal community by delivering news “they want to know” while still including\neditor-picked must-reads to avoid filter bubbles.\n7. Transcription, Translation and Content Summarization\nAI excels at converting content from one form to another, which can greatly speed up newsroom\nworkflows and expand audience reach. This category includes transcribing audio/video to text,\ntranslating between languages, and summarizing long texts into briefs.\nExample 1: ICIR (Nigeria). The International Centre for Investigative Reporting in Nigeria built\nNativeAI for Newsrooms 20, a speech transcription and translation assistant tailored to local\nneeds. This AI tool automatically transcribes audio or video interviews into text and then\ntranslates the text into Nigeria’s three major languages (Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba). Unlike generic\ntools, it was trained to handle Nigerian accents and dialects, solving a huge pain point –\nreporters no longer spend hours manually transcribing recordings, and stories can be quickly\nproduced in multiple languages. This has broadened the reach of ICIR’s reporting to non-\nEnglish speakers and made their journalism more inclusive.\n8. AI-Generated Visuals and Media\nVisual journalism is also benefiting from AI. Newsrooms can use generative AI tools to create\nimages, graphics, or even synthetic voice and video, especially when resources are limited or a\nquick illustration is needed.\nExample: Scroll.in (India). Digital news site Scroll.in introduced an AI system called Factivo to\nautomatically repurpose text articles into short videos. 21 During India’s 2024 general election,\nthey fed election news stories into Factivo, which generated concise video summaries complete\nnigeria#:~:text=The%20problem%20they%20wanted%20to,understand%20and%20serve%20local%20la\nnguages with graphics and subtitles. These AI-made explainer videos (clearly labeled as AI content) were\npushed to Instagram, resulting in a sharp spike in follower engagement and sharing. The small\nScroll team saw this as a way to meet audiences on social media with visual content without\nhiring a full video crew. Encouraged by the results, they are expanding Factivo to turn articles\ninto other formats (audio streams, interactive charts) to enrich storytelling.\n9. Comment Moderation and Community Interaction\nManaging the community conversation around news is a challenge that AI can help solve. Small\nnewsrooms often struggle to moderate comments or engage readers in civil discourse due to\nlimited staff. AI tools can detect toxic or spam comments, assist moderators in reviewing posts\nfaster, and even prompt productive discussions by guiding commenters.\nExample: Rappler (Philippines). Investigative outlet Rappler built an AI chatbot named “Rai” to\ninteract with readers and leverage its archives.22 Initially trialled as a moderator in private chat\nforums, Rai graduated in late 2024 into a public-facing Q&A assistant on Rappler’s app.\nReaders can ask Rai questions about the news (“What’s the latest on the election fraud case?”)\nand the bot responds with concise answers drawn exclusively from Rappler’s 400,000+\npublished stories. The AI cites its sources and sticks to verified information, building trust while\ngiving the audience a new way to explore reporting. This kind of AI-driven community\ninteraction, essentially a virtual journalist answering queries 24/7, has increased user\nengagement and time spent on Rappler’s platform.\n10. Business and Revenue Optimization (Subscriptions, Paywalls & Analytics)\nBeyond editorial tasks, AI is also being applied to the business side of news media – helping\noutlets increase reader revenue and financial sustainability. Machine learning can analyze user\nbehavior and conversion data to optimize paywalls, predict subscriber churn, personalize\nmarketing offers, and even identify new product opportunities.\nExample: Sowt (Jordan). Amman-based podcast company Sowt Media built an AI-powered\nanalytics platform to drive subscriptions and ads revenue.23 The system aggregates user data\nfrom across their products (podcast listens, website visits, newsletter clicks) into a single\ndashboard and then uses machine learning to predict user behavior. For example, within a day\nor two of a new marketing campaign launch, the AI can forecast that campaign’s conversion\nperformance – allowing Sowt to adjust messaging or budgeting in near-real-time. It also\nsegments audiences (by interests or geography) and suggests optimal pricing and content\nbundles for each group. This data-driven approach has made Sowt’s marketing far more\nefficient: early results in 2025 showed higher subscriber sign-ups and reduced customer churn,\nas the company can proactively target those at risk of cancelling. These AI insights into\naudience habits and pricing are helping a mid-sized Middle Eastern media outlet compete with\nlarger players on the business front."
