AI does not understand\nmeaning, but instead it predicts likely outputs based on data.\nAlgorithm\nA set of rules or instructions a computer follows to perform a task. In journalism, algorithms\noften determine how content is processed, ranked or generated.\nLarge Language Model (LLM)\nA type of AI trained on vast amounts of text to generate language. LLMs predict what word is\nlikely to come next, based on patterns, not truth.\nHallucination\nWhen an AI system produces information that sounds confident but is false or invented. Hallucinations are a known limitation, not a rare bug.\nTraining Data\nThe data used to teach an AI system how to behave. Biases and gaps in training data are\nreflected in outputs.\nOpen Source\nSoftware whose code is publicly available and can be inspected, modified and run locally.\nOften safer and more transparent for journalism.\nCloud-Based Tool\nA tool that processes data on external servers rather than on the user’s device. This can\ncreate security and privacy risks.\nLocal Processing\nRunning software entirely on a user’s own computer, without sending data to the internet.\nOften preferred for sensitive material.\nMetadata\nInformation about data, such as time, location, device type or author. Metadata can expose\nsources even when content seems anonymous.\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\nA technique that allows AI to answer questions using a specific set of documents, rather than\ngeneral internet data. Useful for private archives.\nAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR)\nTechnology that converts spoken audio into written text. Used by journalists to transcribe\ninterviews, press briefings, podcasts and field recordings at speed and scale.\nWhisper\nAn open-source speech-to-text model developed by OpenAI, known for high accuracy\nacross accents, noisy audio and multiple languages. Widely used as the underlying engine in\ntranscription tools for journalism, podcasts and interviews.\nSpeech-to-Text\nA category of AI systems that convert spoken language into written text. Used by journalists\nto rapidly turn interviews, meetings, and audio recordings into editable transcripts.\nGraphics Processing Unit (GPU)\nA specialized processor designed to handle large numbers of calculations in parallel. AI tools\nuse GPUs to transcribe audio, generate text, or process images much faster than standard CPUs.\nCommand Line Interface (CLI)\nA text-based way of interacting with software by typing commands instead of clicking\nbuttons. Common in advanced AI workflows, but usually unnecessary for everyday newsroom\nuse.\nEnd-to-End Encryption (E2EE)\nA security method where only the sender and recipient can read the content of messages or\nfiles. Critical for protecting sources, sensitive communications and investigative material.\nIntegrated Development Environment (IDE)\nA software workspace that combines code editing, testing, and debugging in one place. Used\nmainly by developers building or customizing AI tools, not by most journalists directly.\nLarge Language Model (LLM)\nAn AI system trained on vast amounts of text to understand, generate and analyze language.\nPowers tools for writing, summarization, translation, research assistance, and chat interfaces.\nOptical Character Recognition (OCR)\nTechnology that converts scanned documents or images of text into machine-readable text.\nEssential for working with PDFs, court records, archival material, and photographed\ndocuments.\nOpen-Source Intelligence (OSINT)\nInformation gathered from publicly available sources such as social media, websites, and\ndatabases. Used in investigations, verification, and background research without relying on\nconfidential sources.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nA technique where an AI model retrieves information from specific documents before\ngenerating an answer. Improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations when working with\ntrusted newsroom data.\nText-to-Speech (TTS)\nTechnology that converts written text into spoken audio. Used for accessibility, audio articles,\nvoice previews and rapid multilingual publishing.\nVirtual Private Network (VPN)\nA tool that encrypts internet traffic and masks a user’s location. Important for journalist safety, privacy, and working in high-risk or censored environments.\nStable Diffusion\nAn AI system that generates images from written descriptions, such as illustrations, photos,\nor visual concepts. It can be used on personal computers or through online services, giving\nusers more control over how images are created and where the data is processed.\nOpen-Weight Models\nAI models that anyone can download and run themselves, rather than only accessing through\na company’s website or app. This means organizations can use the model on their own\ncomputers or servers, with more control over privacy, cost and how the tool behaves.\nRSS Feeds\nA simple way for websites to automatically send updates when new content is published.\nUsed by journalists to monitor multiple news sites or government pages without visiting each\none manually.\nAPIs (Application Programming Interfaces)\nA structured way for one system to share data directly with another system. Used in\nnewsrooms to automatically pull information such as election results, weather data or public\nrecords into tools and workflows."
