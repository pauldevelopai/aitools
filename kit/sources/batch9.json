      "ai_extract": "The case study describes YESEO, a Slack-based assistant used by The Oglethorpe\nEcho to streamline routine outputs (headlines, social posts, newsletter copy) and to speed up onboarding by generating background on people and local issues from the newsroom’s own archive, reducing time lost to adnhoc searches.",

They describe plans to convert their ElectionWatch approach into an AI newsroom kit and training package, while limiting generative AI to final-stage summarisation to reduce hallucination risk.",

      "ai_extract": "Shomrim’s SourceGuard is described as a tool that flags dozens of credibility flaws\n(missing context, unsubstantiated claims, linguistic bias). The write-up highlights calibration work to balance model freedom vs hallucinations, plus a feedback mechanism where journalists can dispute the AI’s findings—aimed at ‘cyborg journalism’ where the system improves alongside the newsroom’s critical reading.",

      "ai_extract": "IMS summarises a scoping study using interviews, newsroom observation, and document analysis across multiple African regions. It notes that AI use exists but adoption remains relatively low overall, varies by region and outlet type, and is most evident in Kenya and South Africa; larger well-resourced organisations invest in premium systems and custom tools, while smaller outlets often rely on open-source tools.",
