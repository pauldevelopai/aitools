It creates hyper-realistic text-to- speech (TTS) and offers voice cloning capabilities that are virtually indistinguishable from human speech. The platform offers \"Voice Design\" to create custom voices and \"Voice Cloning\" to replicate a specific person's voice from a short sample. Its \"Dubbing Studio\" automatically translates video audio into other languages while preserving the original speaker's voice characteristics and syncing the lips (in some modes). ElevenLabs has set the benchmark for quality but also sparked ethical debates regarding deepfakes.
