It is especially useful for cleaning spreadsheets, fixing inconsistencies, and preparing data so it can be properly analysed. It is widely used in data journalism because many official datasets are incomplete, inconsistent, or badly structured. Essential for cleaning government datasets where \"Chisinau\", \"Chișinău\", and \"Kishinev\" need to be merged into one entry. The tool looks similar to a spreadsheet, but it is much more powerful. Originally developed with Google’s support and later released to the public, OpenRefine is now maintained by a global community and is considered a standard tool for cleaning and preparing data before reporting.",
