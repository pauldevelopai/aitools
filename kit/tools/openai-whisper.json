  "description": "Open-source automatic speech transcription model that can be run locally for security. Developed by OpenAI and released as open-source 36 Whisper represents a rare moment where a frontier AI lab released a state-of-the-art model weights-and-all. While OpenAI is a corporate entity, the open sourcing of Whisper empowers the sovereign individual. . Trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual, multitask supervised data, Whisper excels at robustness against accents, background noise, and technical jargon. Because it runs via Python or command-line interface (CLI) locally,37 there are no file size limits or upload caps— only the limitations of the user's hardware.",
  "purpose": "The gold standard for secure, high-accuracy transcription.",
  "journalism_relevance": "Whisper is currently the only model that handles code- switching 38 (mixing different languages in one sentence) effectively. It supports v3/discussions/207#:~:text=Code%20Switching%20using%20Whisper,tuning Georgian and Armenian with reasonable accuracy, though dialects remain challenging.",

    "time_saved": "Eliminates the need to record, re-record, and edit voiceovers by automatically generating narration directly from text or slides.",
    "reinvestment": "Use the saved time to review the original audio more carefully, note hesitations or emphasis, verify quotes, and focus on editorial judgment rather than mechanical transcription."

  "comments": "The app is free. It requires command Line and terminal knowledge. And there is a zero chance of data leakage, it runs entirely offline.",
