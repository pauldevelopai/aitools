  "description": "Tool for safely opening and sanitising documents from untrusted sources. Dangerzone is a security tool designed specifically for journalists handling untrusted documents from anonymous sources. It converts potentially malicious PDFs, Word files, or images into safe, inert PDFs by opening them in a sandboxed environment and reconstructing them as images. Developed by Micah Lee at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, Dangerzone assumes all leaked documents are hostile until proven otherwise.",
  "purpose": "Safe handling of leaks and anonymous submissions.",
  "journalism_relevance": "Prevents malware attacks embedded in documents—one of the most common attack vectors against journalists.",
