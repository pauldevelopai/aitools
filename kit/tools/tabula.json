Tabula is a specialized tool designed to solve one specific, painful problem: extracting data tables from PDF files into CSV or Excel formats. It is widely used by investigative journalists to liberate data locked in government reports. Tabula runs locally in a web browser. Users upload a PDF, draw a box around the table, and Tabula attempts to parse the layout and extract the text into cells.",
