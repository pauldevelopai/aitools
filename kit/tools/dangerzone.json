  "description": "Local document sanitisation tool that converts untrusted files into safe, non-executable PDFs. Dangerzone is a specialized security tool that sanitizes potentially malicious documents. It takes untrusted PDFs, office documents, or images and converts them into safe, inert PDFs. Dangerzone works by creating a sandbox (a secure, isolated environment) where you can open the suspicious file and convert it 65 into raw pixel data (images), and then reconstruct a new PDF from those images. Developed by Micah Lee at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, Dangerzone is explicitly designed for journalists handling leaks from anonymous sources.",
