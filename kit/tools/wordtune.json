  "description": "Writing assistant that rewrites sentences to adjust tone, clarity, and emphasis. Wordtune is an AI-powered writing companion focused on phrasing and tone. Unlike a grammar checker, it rewrites sentences to be more casual, formal, concise, or expanded, acting as a \"co-writer\" rather than a proofreader. Excellent for overcoming writer's block or refining non-native English. The tool's purpose: To help journalists quickly improve sentence clarity, tone, and flow without changing the underlying meaning of their reporting. scraping/#:~:text=AI%20startup%20Perplexity%20is%20crawling,to%20internet%20infrastructure%20pro vider%20Cloudflare standard-scrape-publisher-sites-licensing-2024-06- 21/#:~:text=Exclusive%3A%20Multiple%20AI%20companies%20bypassing,scraping%20of%20their%20c ontent Relevance to journalism: Particularly useful for journalists writing in a second language or under deadline pressure, Wordtune helps refine copy while keeping editorial control with the reporter, not the tool.",
