  "description": "Encrypted email service designed for secure communications. ProtonMail is an encrypted email service designed with privacy in mind. Based in Switzerland, it provides end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for emails between ProtonMail users, meaning the messages are encrypted on the sender’s device and can only be decrypted by the recipient. Even when emailing non-ProtonMail contacts, ProtonMail allows you to send a password- protected encrypted message that the recipient can decrypt with a shared password. The service is open source and has a user-friendly interface similar to mainstream email, making secure email accessible without special technical knowledge.",
  "purpose": "Secure email for sensitive journalistic communications.",
  "journalism_relevance": "Prevents third parties—including email providers—from accessing message content, reducing exposure when handling confidential information or whistleblower contact.",
