The 5/10 cost rating is adequate for small or occasional use, but it doesn’t reflect pricing when you start automating frequently or adding large numbers of AI steps. Zapier is ideal for teaching automation without losing editorial control. Time Dividend: • How time is saved: Removes manual copying, pasting, forwarding, and status checking. • Ways to reinvest the time: Editorial judgment, follow-up reporting, and source development. Teaching guidance When chatting to your students, emphasise that agents do not replace editorial judgment, they reallocate attention. Students should understand that deciding what an agent watches is itself an editorial act. And be sure, when talking to your students, to stress the difference between automation which is safe and predictable and autonomy which is unpredictable and risky. Also, when talking to students, stress that they need to map workflows before introducing agents. This can be even with a pen and paper. And this is good advice for vibe-coding as well. Even if AI can handle the details and code, it still struggles with pulling out to the macro. So, tell students if they cannot explain a process clearly, they are not ready to automate it. Students should leave this cluster understanding: 1. Agents can appear consistent while being wrong. When multiple agents agree or reinforce each other’s outputs, errors can look more credible rather than less. Journalists must recognise false consensus and step in before agreement is mistaken for verification. 2. Agents follow instructions, not intent. An agent will execute rules exactly as defined, even when circumstances change or ethical context shifts. Journalists must recognise when rigid automation is producing technically correct but editorially inappropriate results and intervene. Exercise 1: Define the handover point Students are given a short description of an agentic workflow (e.g. an agent that monitors council agendas and flags agenda items that match predefined keywords). Students must identify: • What the agent is allowed to do on its own • The exact moment a human must take over and this speaks to the point above around needing to design workflows (even if just on pen and paper) before you can start automating and part of this is knowing where these handover points are. • Where is the point that should force human review. Learning outcome: Teaches boundary-setting and intervention points without system design. Exercise 2: Map a failure to a decision Students are given a brief failure scenario. For example, an agent misses a late-posted document or flags a routine item as urgent. Students need to determine: • What decision the agent made correctly • What decision it made incorrectly • Which human decision could have prevented harm Learning outcome: Shifts focus from “what went wrong” to “where responsibility sits”. Where should you start? Start with: Claude Projects or Custom GPTs. Why: Low technical barrier, immediate usefulness. What it teaches well: How persistent context changes analysis. Why instructions matter more than prompts. Best teaching use: Investigations, policy reporting, archive work. Introduce next: n8n (selectively). Why: Shows how agents are actually built in practice. What it teaches well: Systems thinking, accountability, and auditability. Avoid initially: Fully autonomous agents. Why: They teach the wrong lessons first, spectacle over responsibility. Addendum A: Tools with Risks 1) The Transcription Trap In the high-pressure environment of a newsroom, the transcription of interviews is a bottleneck. For decades, this was a manual, labour-intensive process. The arrival of AI has promised to reclaim hours of productivity. However, this convenience (in certain cases and with certain tools) comes with a severe hidden cost: the loss of custody over source data. Otter.ai Tool Overview: Otter.ai is the market leader in consumer AI transcription, known for its \"OtterPilot\" feature that automatically joins meetings to record and transcribe conversations. What is the risk? The primary risk with Otter.ai is its architecture of aggressive data ingestion. The \"OtterPilot\" bot can join meetings automatically if calendar permissions are granted, potentially recording off-the-record pre-ambles or conversations where not all parties have consented. 116 In 2024 and 2025, the company faced class-action litigation117 in the United States alleging violations of wiretapping laws, specifically regarding the non-consensual recording of voice biometrics. The data resides on US-based servers, subject to foreign subpoenas. And more critically, the privacy policy allows for the use of audio data to train the company's AI models. This means a whistleblower's voice is processed, tokenized, and potentially retained within the model's training corpus. 2) The Writing Process Grammarly Tool Overview: A cloud-based writing assistant that checks spelling, grammar, and tone. Grammarly functions by transmitting every keystroke in an active text field to its cloud servers for analysis. For a journalist investigating state corruption or organized crime, this is an operational security failure. The text of a draft investigation, containing names, dates, and allegations, is exposed to Grammarly's infrastructure before it is even published. lessons-from-the-otter-ai-class-action-complaint/ What is the risk? The 2024–2025 integration of generative AI features increases the likelihood that user data feeds into broader language models. 118 Universities and corporations with high security requirements often ban Grammarly for this exact reason. 3) Visual Journalism Visual storytelling is dominated by short-form video (TikTok, Reels). The tools required to compete in this algorithmic arena—offering auto-captions, filters, and snappy transitions are predominantly mobile-first and data-hungry. The risk here is biometric harvesting. CapCut Tool Overview: The most popular mobile video editor, owned by ByteDance (parent of TikTok). What is the risk? CapCut is a consumer video-editing application whose data collection and licensing practices have raised significant privacy and surveillance concerns among regulators and legal commentators. In 2024-2025, it faced class-action lawsuits in the US (Illinois) for violating the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). 119 The lawsuits allege that CapCut collects biometric identifiers, including facial and voice data, as well as device and location information, without obtaining consent required under Illinois law. 120. CapCut updated its Terms of Service on June 12, 2025, which have drawn legal and public criticism121 because they grant broad rights to user-generated content, including rights to use, edit, reproduce, and exploit content worldwide, with implications for biometric features (these include facial recognition and voice patterns). This update expanded the scope of what CapCut can legally do with uploaded content without separate user consent. For a journalist in the CEE region, the geopolitical risk is acute. ByteDance is subject to Chinese security laws.122 4) The Communication Infrastructure For certain parts of the world, Telegram is not just a messenger app, it is the internet. It is the primary source of news, alerts, and social organization. However, for a journalist, relying on it for private communication is a dangerous fallacy. bytedance-data-collection Telegram Tool Overview: The fatal flaw of Telegram is that Cloud Chats are not End-to-End Encrypted by default. Telegram holds the decryption keys. 123 This means the company, and by extension, any entity that can coerce the company, can read the messages. Only “Secret Chats” are true end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) and must be manually enabled124. The Better Alternative: Signal Tool Overview: An encrypted messenger owned by a non-profit foundation. Signal minimizes metadata retention 125 . Even if subpoenaed, Signal can typically only produce the date of account creation and the date of last login. It is the gold standard for contact. Addendum B: AI & The Strategic Reinvestment of Time The most dangerous outcome of AI adoption is the Jevons Paradox: where increased efficiency simply leads to increased consumption (or in this case, production of low-value content), leaving staff just as burned out as before. If AI saves a reporter 5 hours a week, and the newsroom simply demands 5 more articles of the same quality, the opportunity for transformation is lost. The strategic goal of AI in the newsroom is not to reduce headcount (fire staff) but to upgrade the value of human labour. 126 This section outlines a strategy for the \"AI Dividend\". This is the deliberate reinvestment of saved time into high-value activities that bolster the newsroom's offering. Quantifying the Dividend The Thomson Reuters 2024 Future of Professionals report indicates that AI tools can save professionals approximately 12 hours per week 127 by 2029. The report likened this to adding a colleague for every 10 team members, highlighting how productivity gains can aggregate across an organisation. The \"Stop Doing\" List: A Prerequisite for Reinvestment Reinvestment cannot happen without a deliberate cessation of low-value tasks 128. Leadership must sanction a \"Stop Doing\" list to create the capacity for new work. This requires a rigorous audit of current newsroom activities. The critical management challenge is tracking this time and ensuring it is not absorbed by \"shallow work\" (emails, Slack, browsing). Strategic Reinvestment Areas Strategy 1: Investigative & Enterprise Time saved from churning out \"commodity news\" (press release rewrites, basic event coverage) should be directed toward original reporting.",
